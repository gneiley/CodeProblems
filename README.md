# CodeProblems
In completing code problems, I thought it would be cool if I could add the completed code to a solution that would allow a "user" to run the application, then choose which code problem to run, continue to run it, return to main menu, run a new problem, and exit the solution as desired without exiting the program. 
This repo contians setup for broader solution all code problems should be added to.
